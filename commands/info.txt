For fully functional slash commands, there are 3 important pieces of code that need to be written. They are
1) The individual command files, containing their definitions and functionality
2) The command handler, which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands
3) The command deployment script, to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface
All are required before the commands are fully functional

Step 1
- You'll be using the SlashCommandBuilder class to construct the command definitions
- At a minimum, the definition of a slash command must have a name and a description.
	- Slash command names must be between 1-32 characters and contain no capital letters, spaces, or symbols other than - and _
- A slash command also requires a function to run when the command is used, to respond to the interaction
- Using an interaction response method confirms to Discord that you rbot successfully recieved the interaction and has responded to the user
	- Discord enforces this to ensure that all slash commands provide a good user experience (UX)
	- Failing to respond will cause Discord to show that the command failed, even if your bot is performing other actions as a result
	- Simplest way to acknowledge and respond to an interaction is with the 'interaction.reply()' method
	- Other methods covered later
